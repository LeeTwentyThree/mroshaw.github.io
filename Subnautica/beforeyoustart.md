# Before you begin

Coding and writing mods is fun! It's more fun with the support of a community of brilliant, helpful, fellow modders. This guide wouldn't have been possible without the help and support of this community. Supporting such a community is as much about giving and sharing as it is about receiving help and support.

Therefore, I would suggest you do two things before you begin:

-   **Get yourself onto the [Subnautica Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/srQXTPKA)** - lurk, get involved, learn, ask questions, it's all good!

-   **Set yourself up a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/)** -- sharing and collaborating on code is one of the best ways to learn and improve. It's easy to do, just get yourself onto GitHub.com and register. We'll cover creating your first repository in the next section.

Finally, a couple more pointers before we start:

1. The examples below will use Subnautica: Below Zero. The principals, process and concepts are identical for the original Subnautica game, but do note that the tutorial is specifically focused on BZ.

2. Where I refer to \<game>, this is the folder in which your Subnautica game is installed. For example, for me, it's: 

   `C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\SubnauticaZero`

Right, let's make a mod!
