# Getting Started

## Tools you'll need

You'll want to setup your development machine with the following tools:

-   **Visual Studio** - this is where we'll write our mod code.

-   **dnSpy** - this essential tool helps you to explore the code in the game and find useful methods and fields to target and modify.

-   **QMod Manager** - this will help integrate your mod into the game, as well as provide useful functions to simplify your code.

-   **SML Helper** - not mandatory, but this mod provides loads of useful functions so that you don't have to write them yourself.

-   **BepInExPublicizer** - not mandatory, but this plugin "unlocks" protected methods and fields in game objects that makes modding much more powerful.

-   **Vortex** - not mandatory, but useful for installing and updated base mods in your games.

-   **GitHub Desktop** - not mandatory, but good to manage your source code in a Git repository, which will allow you to share and collaborate with others.

-   **Subnautica / Below Zero** - you'll need to have games themselves installed, of course!

Here's a simple checklist of the tools, the versions used at the time of writing, and where to get them. You can check these off once you've set them all up, too.

Don't forget to endorse the mods that you download and use from Nexusmods.

Once you've got everything downloaded, let's get it all setup and ready to go.

**NOTE:** Don't worry too much about version numbers. Generally, the latest is fine, though look out for .NET Framework and compatibility between mods.
