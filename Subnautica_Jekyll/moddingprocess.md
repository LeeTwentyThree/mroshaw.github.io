# The Modding Process

Okay, so you can ignore this section if you like. I think it's useful to talk a bit about planning, designing and balancing your mod.

There are a load of reasons for modding a game and it can be a very personal thing. In fact, many mod authors build mods for themselves, to make the game more like the game they themselves wanted it to be. They share their mods because, well, because they're generally very nice people who just like to share the love of their favourite games with people who feel the same way.

That said, if you want to build mods to enhance the game, build on the universe and systems that the game presents, and you want it to enhance the game of others, it's worth having a plan. Think about what you're trying to achieve and how it will "play" for other players and how you might balance some pro's and con's of what you're bringing into the game world. While you're doing that, it's also worthwhile thinking about what objects, classes and methods you might need to work with to build your wonder mod.
